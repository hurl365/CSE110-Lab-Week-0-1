### **Prologue**
![This is Zane Truesdale that I painted more than a year ago](Zane-emote.jpg)
##### Looks like somebody's amped up!
### **Encounter**
*The reason why I got into programming at first was that I wanted to utilize Arduino to create some cool gadgets. Now I realize there are so much more I can do with computers and circuits.* <sub>~~For examples, creating lasers.~~</sub>
### **Rising Actions**
***The following crappy code gives a good demonstration of what I am good at:***
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(){
  char goodAts[][19] = {"Sleep", "Eat and drink", "Go to the bathroom"};
  for(int i = 0; i <= 3; i++) {
      int index = i+1;
      printf("%d: %s\n", index, &goodAts[i][0]);
  }
  return 0;
}
```
It should supposedly have a segmentation fault, but it will depend on the implementation of the system.
### **Climax**
*Here is a list of programming languages I have worked with:*
- C, C++, C#
- Java
- Swift
- Python

<sub>*This list is subject to change soon.</sub>
 
*This is how I rank them from my most favourite to the least*
1. C
2. Java, C#, Swift
3. C++, Python

<sub>*This order is subject to change soon.</sub>

### **Falling Actions**
 > Outside of programming, I love digital art and I paint [anime](Leader anim.gif) from time to time. [Go back up]() to check out my painting again!
> I also like to work in our [community](https://eceusc.ucsd.edu/).
### **Conclusions**
*Here are some short and long term goals I have:*
- [x] Get started on GitHub
- [ ] Learn to use Git well on command line.
- [ ] Catch up on school work
